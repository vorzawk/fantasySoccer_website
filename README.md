# Fantasy Soccer League
This website allows users to build their own soccer teams and earn points based on the selected players' performance in the real leagues. The user with the most points at the end of the week is the winner.

### User Interface
The goal of the fantasy league is to choose a team of 11 players from a database of 15000+ players from around the world. Depending on their performance in the actual soccer game, points are assigned. For eg, if a player on the team scores a goal, the user gets 5 points, 3 points for an assist and so on.
The chosen team must consist of 2 forwards, 4 midfielders, 4 defenders and 1 goalkeeper. The chosen players can belong to any of the clubs in any of the soccer leagues around the world. Points are assigned based on the teamâ€™s performance.

### Implementation
The fantasy league is powered by a MySQL database consisting of all the soccer players data. The UI is implemented using HTML and PHP.
